This is a Ma lab copy of the original GitHub repository and code base, kept here for archival purposes. Please go to https://github.com/kathadobs/facecueint for possible updates.

Code and data accompanying "Near-optimal integration of facial form and motion" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10885-y by Katharina Dobs, Wei Ji Ma and Leila Reddy.

This code can be used to run the model fitting based on 1) the optimal, 2) the best-cue, 3) the simple-averaga and 4) the incorrect-belief model.

Run the model fitting with runModelFitJoint.m in Matlab (needs the Optimization toolbox).

The stimuli of the study can be downloaded on OSF: https://osf.io/f7snh/.
