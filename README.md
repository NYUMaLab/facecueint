Code and data accompanying "Near-optimal integration of facial form and motion" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10885-y.

This code can be used to run the model fitting based on 1) the optimal, 2) the best-cue, 3) the simple-averaga and 4) the incorrect-belief model.

Run the model fitting with runModelFitJoint.m in Matlab (needs the Optimization toolbox).
